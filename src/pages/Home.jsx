              <p>
                My journey began with curiosity and a stubborn Google search,
                ‚Äúhow to build a website.‚Äù What started as basic HTML and CSS
                turned into late-night experiments and an increasing obsession
                with how things work behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As my passion grew, so did my skills. I explored JavaScript and
                mastered frameworks like React and Vue. I also worked with
                Node.js. Each bug, build, and breakthrough taught me something
                new; I learned about clean architecture and performance
                optimization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, with over 3 years of experience, I focus on creating apps
                that are not only functional but also enjoyable. Whether I‚Äôm
                designing smooth UIs or writing logic that simply works, I‚Äôm
                still learning, still building, and still just getting started.
